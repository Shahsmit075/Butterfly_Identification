## üìñ Introduction  
Our project focuses on developing a *Flutter-based mobile application* designed to identify butterfly species native to Gujarat. Combining state-of-the-art AI technologies with an intuitive mobile experience, the app provides:

- *Real-time butterfly identification* through image segmentation and classification.
- A *comprehensive catalog of 109 butterfly species* with detailed information on each.
- Tools tailored for *researchers, enthusiasts, and conservationists* to promote biodiversity awareness and conservation efforts.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Methodology  

### 1. *Data Collection and Preprocessing*  
   - Collected images of butterfly species from Gujarat from reliable online sources.  
   - Applied preprocessing techniques to optimize the dataset for training.  

### 2. *Model Selection*  
   - Tested multiple architectures, including ResNet and DenseNet.  
   - Selected *VGG-16* for its superior performance, achieving *85% accuracy*.  

### 3. *Image Segmentation*  
   - Implemented *SAM* to isolate butterflies from their surroundings.  
   - Enhanced classification reliability by focusing on segmented objects.  

### 4. *Flutter App Development*  
   - Designed and developed a user-friendly app with key functionalities:  
     - Login/Signup  
     - Species catalog  
     - History tracking
